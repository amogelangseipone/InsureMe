# Car Insurance Premium Calculator (HTML & CSS)

## Project Overview  
This project is a simple, static web interface designed to simulate a car insurance premium calculator. It collects user inputs such as age, gender, and accident history. However, no actual calculations or data processing occur because the project uses only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript or backend logic is implemented.

## Features  
- **HTML form**: Collects user inputs relevant to insurance premium assessment.  
- **Responsive design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Clean and user-friendly UI**: Focused on clarity, simplicity, and ease of navigation using CSS styling.

## Whatâ€™s Missing  
- No dynamic processing: The "Calculate" button does not perform calculations or show results.  
- Future improvements could include adding JavaScript logic to process inputs and compute premiums dynamically.

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates the visual and structural foundation of a car insurance premium calculator. It is intended to showcase frontend design skills and form creation, with plans to extend functionality later.
